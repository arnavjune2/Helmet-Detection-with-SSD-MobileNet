# Helmet-Detection-with-SSD-MobileNet
Traffic Rule Violation is very common nowadays. Many riders as well as the passengers barely wear helmet while riding two wheelers. It is increasing day by day there are some problems happening like evaluation of traffic rules like not wearing helmet while driving or riding in the streets &amp; as a result, many serious accidents happen very often and many more.   So here we are doing an AI application which will detect the helmets and this AI can be applied in all sorts of the problem discussed above.

The Helmet Detection system is a web application which will detect the type of vehicles from the image which is being uploaded into the application and gives you detection by giving a bounding box for the Helmet. The Helmet Detection system designed will have many components. Most of these components will be programmed, while others will be implementations of open-source packages. The user interface will be using HTML/CSS to display the pages, Flask for deploying models and running the server.
